# Multiband Turing machine simulator

This is a multitape Turing machine Simulator.

A multitape Turing machine can have multiple tapes and heads, which can move independently of each other.

Build it with the Makefile by executing `make`.

Execute with `multitape_tm [-v] <program file> <tape file>`. 

The `-v` flag is for verbose output.

Examples of multitape programs are available in the examples folder.
